Weather App Project - README
Project Overview

The Weather App is a dynamic web application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's location or a searched location. Leveraging the OpenWeather API, the app displays current weather, forecasts, air quality index, and other relevant weather data.

Features

Current Weather: Displays temperature, weather description, and location.

5-Day Forecast: Detailed weather forecast for the next five days.

Hourly Forecast: Hour-by-hour weather forecast for the current day.

Air Quality Index (AQI): Provides AQI details, including information on various pollutants.

Sunrise and Sunset Times: Displays the times for sunrise and sunset.

Additional Metrics: Includes humidity, pressure, visibility, and "feels like" temperature.

Search Functionality: Allows users to search for weather information by location.

Current Location Detection: Fetches weather data for the user's current location using the Geolocation API.

Error Handling: Displays error messages when data fetching fails.


Skills Demonstrated
1. API Integration
Fetch API: Retrieves weather data from the OpenWeather API.
Error Handling: Manages failed requests and displays appropriate error messages.

2. Event Handling
Event Listeners: Handles user interactions such as search input, location toggling, and fetching data.

3. DOM Manipulation
Dynamic Content: Creates and inserts HTML elements based on fetched weather data.
Class Manipulation: Manages visibility, active states, and display of weather data.

4. Geolocation API
Current Location Detection: Fetches and displays weather data based on the user's geographical location.

5. Modular JavaScript
ES6 Modules: Organizes the project into separate modules for better maintainability.
Reusable Functions: Centralizes common utility functions for reuse across the project.

6. Asynchronous JavaScript
Promises: Handles asynchronous operations, such as data fetching.
Timeout Functions: Manages user input delays to optimize API calls.

7. Data Handling and Parsing
JSON Parsing: Extracts and uses weather data from API responses.
Date and Time Manipulation: Converts Unix timestamps to readable formats, adjusted for timezones.

8. Responsive Design
CSS Flexbox: Ensures the app is responsive and visually appealing on various devices.

9. Error Handling and Validation
Form Validation: Validates user inputs, such as checking for empty search fields.
Error Messages: Displays appropriate messages when data fetching fails.

10. User Experience Enhancements
Loading Indicators: Visual cues to indicate ongoing data fetching processes.
Search Autocomplete: Provides search suggestions to enhance the user experience.
